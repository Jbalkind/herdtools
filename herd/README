If you would like syntax highlighting for .cat files,
and you currently use emacs with Tuareg mode, then
copy the following into your ~/.emacs file.


;; "cat mode" is derived from tuareg-mode
;; which is the normal mode for editing
;; OCaml code
(define-derived-mode cat-mode tuareg-mode
  (setq mode-name "herd model")
) 
;; Define extra keywords. I don't know what
;; the semantic difference is between a
;; governing, a keyword, and a builtin is,
;; so I just picked it so the colours are
;; nice.
(font-lock-add-keywords 'cat-mode '(
  ("unshow"   . tuareg-font-lock-governing-face)
  ("show"   . tuareg-font-lock-governing-face)
  ("provides" . tuareg-font-lock-governing-face)
  ("requires" . tuareg-font-lock-governing-face)
  ("rln" . font-lock-keyword-face)
  ("set" . font-lock-keyword-face)
  ("acyclic" . font-lock-builtin-face)
  ("empty" . font-lock-builtin-face)
  ("irreflexive" . font-lock-builtin-face)
))
;; Enter this mode when opening a .cat file
(setq auto-mode-alist 
  (cons '("\\.cat$" . cat-mode) auto-mode-alist)
)
